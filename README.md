I am writing this before I start my assignment. I will add to this as I go, or as I reflect upon my completed project.

After completion of this project I am happy with the results. I appreciate TOP's approach at teaching as I think it fits my learning style. As I came across issues during the process, I was forced to find out the solution on my own and was proud that I never had to ask for help. I was able to incorporate some techniques that I had learned previously that were not taught up to this point on TOP. The website is clean and simple, and I was able to add some of my own personality in the humor to keep it fun for me.

I can't wait to see what I can create in the future and I hope you enjoy this project as much as I do.

p.s- I have no idea what a README is supposed to say xD
